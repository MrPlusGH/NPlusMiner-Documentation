If a GPU is overclocked too high, there is a risk of crashing, freezing, and increase of bad shares.

For advanced overclocking, one can run algorithm specific overclocking by using NvidiaInspector.
The algoritm specific batch files that run NvidiaInspector should be put in the prerun folder.
There is a default-Example.bat file in the prerun folder that has example code in it.
